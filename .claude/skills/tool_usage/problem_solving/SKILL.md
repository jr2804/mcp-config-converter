# Problem Solving

## What I Do

Provide universal patterns for structured problem analysis and solution development that work across different domains and projects.

## Universal Problem-Solving Framework

### Sequential Thinking Process

```python
# Universal problem-solving workflow
from sequential_thinking import sequential_thinking

result = sequential_thinking(
    thought="Analyze the problem from multiple angles",
    nextThoughtNeeded=True,
    thoughtNumber=1,
    totalThoughts=5,
    isRevision=False
)
```

### Universal Thought Patterns

**Analysis Patterns:**

- **Decomposition**: Break problems into smaller components
- **Abstraction**: Identify core principles independent of implementation
- **Analogy**: Find similar problems with known solutions
- **Verification**: Test hypotheses systematically

### Cross-Domain Examples

```python
# Universal problem analysis
thoughts = [
    {
        "thought": "Identify core requirements independent of technology",
        "type": "abstraction"
    },
    {
        "thought": "Break into UI, logic, and data components",
        "type": "decomposition"
    },
    {
        "thought": "Compare with similar authentication systems",
        "type": "analogy"
    }
]
```

## When to Use Me

Use this skill when:

- Analyzing complex, cross-domain problems
- Creating reusable solution patterns
- Standardizing problem-solving approaches
- Building organizational problem-solving frameworks

## Universal Integration

### Decision Documentation

```python
# Universal decision recording
store_memory(
    type="decision",
    title="Universal architecture choice",
    content="Chose X over Y because of Z reasons",
    tags=["architecture", "decision", "universal"],
    relationships=["ADDRESSES:problem-123"]
)
```

### Pattern Extraction

```python
# Universal pattern extraction
if solution_is_reusable:
    store_memory(
        type="code_pattern",
        title="Universal solution pattern",
        content="Reusable code and explanation",
        tags=["pattern", "universal", domain_tags]
    )
```

## Best Practices

1. **Standardization**: Use consistent thought patterns across projects
1. **Documentation**: Record all major decisions and insights
1. **Reusability**: Extract patterns from specific solutions
1. **Collaboration**: Share problem-solving approaches across teams

## Compatibility

Works with:

- Any complex problem domain
- Cross-project knowledge systems
- Organizational learning frameworks
- Universal solution libraries
